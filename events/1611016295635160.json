{"description": "Jimkata\nw/ Ocular Panther\nFlour City Station\nThursday 10.19\n8pm door\n9 PM start\n $12 advance\n $15 at door\n21+\n\nMarking an end of an era, Jimkata celebrates their journey by kicking off their Farewell Tour at Flour City Station on Thursday October 19th before heading onto an indefinie hiatus. Ocular Panther will start the night off.\n\nJIMKATA\n\nTake note: Jimkata is not a cool electronic rock band.\n\nI mean, they are. The band\u2019s new album, In Motion, is a triumph of swirling analog synths and breezy pop hooks. It\u2019ll make your body groove.\n\nBut dig deeper. You\u2019ll be rewarded with something more...personal. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great music out there that makes you move, but you don\u2019t remember it afterwards,\u201d says Jimkata frontman Evan Friedell. \u201cWe\u2019re OK with embracing our emotional side. I think we have a little bit of soul. We\u2019re embracing all the things that make classic songs.\u201d\n\nThis added emotional gravitas is borne partially out of trust. Friends since middle school, Friedell, Aaron Gorsch and Packy Lunn infuse Jimkata \u2014 which, yes, is named after the so-bad-it\u2019s-good 1985 gym-fu caper Gymkata\u2014with both an adventurous musical streak and an emotional core. \n\n\u201cI was drawn to music in two ways,\u201d says Friedell. \u201cOne was through the backbeat\u2014I grew up with Michael Jackson and Paul Simon\u2019s Graceland. Everything was rhythmically accentuated. But the second avenue is good songwriting. Something that hits the body and the heart.\u201d\n\nWhich means, mixed in with the modern synth sensibilities (you\u2019ll certainly hear echoes of LCD Soundsystem on album closer \u201cSynapses\u201d) and progressive rock tropes are influences drawn from the likes of Motown, singer-songwriters like James Taylor and even old country songs, where storytelling and a quick turn of phrase share priorities with melody and the beat. \n\nIt\u2019s an unusually rich and rewarding mix, and one that\u2019s evolved naturally. Over the past half-decade, the Ithaca-based band has operated without a record label, publicist or support system of any kind. \u201cWe just road dogged it,\u201d says Friedell. \u201cIt\u2019s all DIY. Doing 150 shows a year, sleeping on floors, recording songs along the way. We built everything organically, all word of mouth. The advice we got when we started was \u2018Just go out and play. It\u2019ll pay off.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Motion marks the band\u2019s second fan-funded record through PledgeMusic. Gorsch\u2019s love of unusual rhythms and vintage synths fuel the album\u2019s first half, highlighted by the pop earworm \u201cWild Ride\u201d and the melancholia of \u201cJumping Out of Airplanes.\u201d Halfway through, the album shifts to a more progressive, guitar-based affair, led by the percussive funk of \u201cInnocence.\u201d It\u2019s an adventurous album, one that could find a home equally amongst fans of Yeasayer, LCD Soundsystem or Tom Petty. \n\nBesides a musical shift, In Motion marks some other important changes. The group recently transitioned to three members from four. As well, the trio was forced off the road for an extended period of time, which ended up\u2014unexpectedly\u2014helping evolve their music.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve been off from touring for a while,\u201d says Friedell. \u201cWe were sort of living like gypsies or nomads, living the road life. We\u2019ve never had this much time to work on an album and just live with the songs. It\u2019s been a creative, reflective time for us.\u201d\n\nLyrically, In Motion doesn\u2019t center on any one theme. \u201cI sort of discover what I\u2019m writing about later,\u201d says the singer. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t always know where the inspiration comes from. But overall, these are songs about processing adversity.\u201d\n\n(Themes that certainly resonate with the band\u2019s fans. \u201cWe\u2019ve had people tattoo our lyrics on their arms. That was a revelation to me\u2014we\u2019re doing something right.\u201d)\n\nFortunately for long-time fans, the band plans to hit the road again early next year. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty high-energy on stage,\u201d says Friedell. \u201cWe tour with a light show and improvise a lot. We\u2019ve toured so much, and experienced every scenario, good or bad. So we know how to play live and create some energy.\u201d\n\nAnd for Jimkata, it\u2019s about finding the right energy\u2014that balance between heart and mind.\n\nSays Friedell: \u201cIdeally, we\u2019re writing songs where someone says, \u2018I know that feeling. That song picks me up. It has real meaning to me.\u2019\u201d\n\nOCULAR PANTHER\n\n\"Ocular Panther is bold; a brash and brilliant example of ethereal pursuit with organic tools. They have melded music from different genres, eras, and approaches to create a new contagion of danceable ambiance and rock grit. Some of the songs exhibit a protracted intro to their varied grooves that grow from a standard hook into a kind of epiphany. It smacks smooth and gloriously disjointed.\"\n\n -Frank De Blas\u00e9, Rochester City Newspaper\n\n \"Ocular Panther\u2019s sound doesn\u2019t so much caress and cajole the listener as it stalks that listener like prey through a jungle that sounds like it erupted from the mind of Salvador Dali. Essentially dance music, the band\u2019s sound employs electro grooves as if they were the obvious basis for a brand of outer-space funk. The music is sinewy and menacing. A blend of world beat, European electro, and a futuristic marriage of both laid the basis for the virtuosic interplay of the musicians, who managed to take what was essentially dance music into some deeply interesting places. Ocular Panther seems to have no trouble crafting music that moves with purpose and forward motion, avoiding the pitfalls of lazy static repetition. Which is to say, this is music that you can dance to, analyze, or simply lose yourself within with equal ease.\"\n\n -Jeff Miers, The Buffalo News\n\nwww.ocularpanther.com", "start_time": "2017-10-19T20:00:00-0400", "place": {"id": "622059694538938", "name": "Flour City Station", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14604", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.59971, "state": "NY", "street": "170 East Ave", "latitude": 43.15669}}, "end_time": "2017-10-20T00:00:00-0400", "id": "1611016295635160", "name": "Jimkata Farewell Tour w/Ocular Panther Flour City Station"}
