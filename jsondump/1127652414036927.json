{"description": "We love playing in Naples, and we really love playing at Roots Cafe - but it's tough to fit all of us and all of you and then still find room to groove!  So, we will be stripping things down a bit for a another rare \"unplugged\" set.  We only do this a couple times a year, but they are always a blast and we could not think of a better setting.
