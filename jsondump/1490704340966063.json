Damien\u2019s obsession with music began at a young age growing up listening to hip hop, rap and punk rock but it wasn\u2019t until he was 20 when he put everything he had into music and decided to become a DJ.\n\n Over the years Hydraulix has received airplay from Triple J and BBC\u2019s Radio 1, as well as support on his tunes from some of the biggest artists in Bass Music such as Bro Safari, UZ, Excision, Snails, Rico Tubbs, Alex Young, Party Favor and many more.\n\nEliminate\nLos Angeles-CA\nhttps://soundcloud.com/eliminatemusic\n\n 22 year old Nathan Merrill is taking dance music to its next level. Fusing jaw-dropping bass lines and catchy, melodic themes with ferocious trap and hip hop influences, Eliminate has shown that genre boundaries mean little to him. His debut \u2018Gravity\u2019 EP immediately shot to number 1 on Beatport\u2019s hip hop release charts, while knocking Skrillex out of the number 1 glitch hop release slot. Eliminate\u2019s unique breed of addictive bass music has quickly garnered massive support from the likes of Excision, Datsik, Krewella, 12th Planet, HeRobust, and many more. His reputation as an up and coming producer powerhouse has already begun to precede him, and he won\u2019t stop there.", "start_time": "2018-02-10T21:00:00-0500", "priority": "9", "place": {"id": "768319583287478", "name": "Photo City Improv: Comedy & Music Venue", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14609", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.569275, "state": "NY", "street": "543 Atlantic Ave", "latitude": 43.156315}}, "end_time": "2018-02-11T02:00:00-0500", "id": "1490704340966063", "name": "Hydraulix | Eliminate at Photo City"}
