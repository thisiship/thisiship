It debuted at #1 on the Billboard Reggae Chart.\n\nFormed in 2001 in Rochester, New York, GPGDS first received praise for their live show, which combined world beats and reggae rhythms within jamband aesthetics. In recent years the band\u2019s studio recordings, which showcase their songwriting and musicianship across all genres of roots music, have further cemented their legend as master innovators and artists. \u201cThere is a lot of intention in this release. We had a purpose to prove to ourselves recording this album [MAKE IT BETTER]. We wanted to know that we could put our heads down and do good work fast. It was a great release artistically. It uniquely sounds the most progressive of anything we have ever done while also sounding the most like our first album.\u201d -James Searl, Bassist/Vocalist", "start_time": "2017-12-02T18:00:00-0500", "priority": "9", "place": {"id": "400372533330965", "name": "Electric Haze", "location": {"city": "Worcester", "zip": "01610", "country": "United States", "longitude": -71.79829, "state": "MA", "street": "26 Millbury St", "latitude": 42.25428}}, "end_time": "2017-12-03T02:00:00-0500", "id": "472818889777923", "name": "Sat 12/2 - Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad"}
