{"description": "THUNDER BODY's Medicine Wednesdays, Miah Reprise Edition.  We need more Miah, more instrumentals, more improvisations, more melodica, more noise.  Miah's last show will be Dec 30 with JBB (for their 2nd to last show).  With thunder in flux, we want to make sure to get some time in for experimentation.  That's what these Wednesdays are gonna be all about.  We will start early with some acoustic songs, then away we go.  These will not be regular thunder body sets.  Just saying.", "start_time": "2017-11-01T20:00:00-0400", "priority": "0", "place": {"id": "189238104475924", "name": "Abilene Bar and Lounge", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14604", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.604294, "state": "NY", "street": "153 Liberty Pole Way", "latitude": 43.160099}}, "end_time": "2017-11-02T23:00:00-0400", "id": "1599810196707631", "name": "Medicine Wednesdays at Abilene"}
