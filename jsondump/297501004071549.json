{"description": "$10 / Age 18 And Up\n\nAdditional Info:\nHaewa: \"Haewa can be better described by what it isn't. The group jams, but it isn't a jam band. It circles psychedelic rock, but doesn't get lost in the ether. It's a rock 'n' roll band that doesn't adhere to merely the one, the four, and the five. It's odd, but not intentionally obtuse....\" - Frank DeBlasePine Needle Soul is a band from Rochester NY featuring an MC, guitar, vocals, bass, keys, sax, and drums. We play in the style of hip hop fusion.Joe Driscoll:An innovator of the live looping beatbox sound, Joe Driscoll has been touring steadily for years, spreading his unique fusion of folk and hip-hop. The modern day take on the one man band, he uses live loops to create soundscapes full of beatbox, guitar, harmonica, percussion, harmonica, and just about anything else he can make use of. After 11 years living in England and France, Joe has moved back to his native city, Syracuse in upstate New York. Driscoll has performed his ground breaking solo show at the famed Glastonbury Festival, Electric Picnic in Ireland, Rift Valley Fest in Kenya, and hundreds of major stages all over the world.\nTickets:\nhttp://www.ticketweb.com/event/haewa-pine-needle-soul-and-funk-n-waffles-music-hall-tickets/7852205?REFERRAL_ID=twfb", "start_time": "2017-12-15T21:00:00-0500", "priority": "9", "place": {"id": "86659589746", "name": "Funk 'n Waffles Rochester", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14604", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.61141, "state": "NY", "street": "204 N Water St", "latitude": 43.16048}}, "id": "297501004071549", "name": "Hyperborealis III: Haewa, Pine Needle Soul, and Joe Driscoll"}
