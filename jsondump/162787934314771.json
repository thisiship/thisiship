{"description": "Folkfaces is a group out of Buffalo, NY that plays a rowdy blend of rootsy Folk, Jazz, and Blues - fusing classic forms with contemporary feelings and irresistibly danceable energy. \n\nTheir inspiration comes from the mountains of Appalachia to the deltas of Mississippi, the swamps of Louisiana to the Concrete Jungle of the Rustbelt. Specializing in merriment and sticking it to the system, Folkfaces make the crowd dance and the hierarchy shatter.\n\nDoors 7\nMusic 8\n$5\n\nEvent photo by Empire West Photo", "start_time": "2017-12-09T19:00:00-0500", "priority": "9", "place": {"id": "126843517347072", "name": "Three Heads Brewing", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14607", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.57965, "state": "NY", "street": "186 Atlantic Ave", "latitude": 43.15675}}, "end_time": "2017-12-09T23:00:00-0500", "id": "162787934314771", "name": "Folkfaces at Three Heads"}
