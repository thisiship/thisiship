{"description": "$5 / Age 18 And Up\n\nAdditional Info:\nPeriodic Table of Elephants: Sean and Jason were introduced in late 2013 through their mutual friend Greg Horton. Initially playing as the band Ack!, the trio performed throughout Rochester in 2014 gaining a small but loyal fan base. Following Greg's departure in January of 2015, Sean & Jason decided to continue their musical collaboration as a duo and adopted their current band name Periodic Table of Elephants. Influenced by many of the post-punk bands of the nineties, PToE's music began to reflect their common roots. Taking cues from other successful two-piece bands, Jason began playing through both guitar and bass amps to better fill out their sound.Shinji Kazama:Stoner rock / Instrumetal band from Rochester NY.
