{"description": "Corey Owens is affectionately known as Big C.  He is also the guy who holds down the drums with Danielle Ponder & The Tomorrow People.  On top of that, he is the man behind Big Boy Catering, which creates some of the best food I have ever eaten.  \n\nAs a Holiday treat for you, Big C is putting on a special event at Three Heads.  It is a 2 part event.   \n\nFirst up, he will be catering a dinner at the brewery for the first 80 people that buy tickets.  That will occur at 6pm and there will be acoustic music provided by Mr. Eli Flynn.  \n\nThen at 8pm, the music hits.  Big C will be leading a band of incredible players:  Avis Reese and Andres Rivera from the Tommorow People, John Viviani from Blue Falcon and Filthy Funk and Tony G from Giant Panda.  Rumors are there will also be an All Star cast of guest singers.   \n\nTickets are $20 for the dinner and music.\nThey will be $10 for just the music.  \nThey will be on sale shortly...stay tuned.", "start_time": "2017-12-23T18:00:00-0500", "priority": "0", "place": {"id": "126843517347072", "name": "Three Heads Brewing", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14607", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.57965, "state": "NY", "street": "186 Atlantic Ave", "latitude": 43.15675}}, "end_time": "2017-12-23T23:00:00-0500", "id": "127823334570169", "name": "Big C's Holiday Gathering"}
