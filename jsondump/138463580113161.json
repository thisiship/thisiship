{"description": "Folkfaces-  No introduction needed...but...\nFolkfaces is a group out of Buffalo, NY that plays a rowdy blend of rootsy Folk, Jazz, and Blues - fusing classic forms with contemporary feelings and irresistibly danceable energy. Their inspiration comes from the mountains of Appalachia to the deltas of Mississippi, the swamps of Louisiana to the Concrete Jungle of the Rustbelt. Specializing in merriment and sticking it to the system, Folkfaces make the crowd dance and the hierarchy shatter.\nhttps://folkfaces.bandcamp.com/music\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nSHOW STARTS AT 10PM\n\nALWAYS FREE at Temple Bar & Grille.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nAny Burger w/ Fry and any Draft Beer only $9.99!!!
