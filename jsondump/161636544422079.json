And a freight train it truly is. Although the quartet's sound is rooted in traditional stringed instruments (guitar, basses, banjo and mandolin), their music surges forward with the strength and power of a hundred-ton diesel locomotive. Songs barrel down the tracks with momentum and intensity normally found in much heavier, heavily amplified music. \u201cAlthough we look like a bluegrass band we are not,\" explains co-founder Eric Munley (mandolin, vocals). \"Collectively, we're a musical representation of the sounds floating around in our heads. We use the instruments of our ancestors, but play music of our time; we're influenced much more by all that has happened in the musical world over the past three decades than by what was created in the first three-quarters of the 20th Century.\" The Blind Owl Band builds on what they regard as a basic approach to traditional songwriting and arranging and push the envelope, stretching the limits of raw, acoustic instrumentation. Munley explains part of the band's mindset: \"In a time of perfection and an increasing reliance on digital processors, we're trying to expand the sound, to inspire use of wood and metal.\" In just under five years the band has released two albums (Rabble Rousing and This Train We Ride is Made of Wood and Steel) and toured extensively throughout the eastern US, logging nearly 600 show across 17 states since January 2012. They've played on almost every festival east of the Mississippi and shared the stage with countless artists across all genres of the musical spectrum. Looking ahead into 2017, the band will begin recording their as-yet-untitled third full length album in early summer, with an eye toward a October 13th, 2017 release. This freight train has no one conductor but four shovel boys pushing the limits of their engine night after night, so climb aboard and get ready for a one-of-a-kind ride.\n\nBella's Bartok - Northampton, MA\nhttp://bellasbartok.com/\nThe circus punk powerhouse Bella\u2019s Bartok infuses klezmer punk with pop sensibilities into a spectacle that can\u2019t help but compel you dance!\n\nLive Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_GSzK_oy_M\n\nTo understand Bella\u2019s Bartok, imagine what you would get if Salvador Dali and Toulouse Lautrec were fronting the Moulin Rouge's house band, and you have the exuberant spectacle that is Bella's Bartok. Described as \"about as much fun as you can have with your pants on\" (Dan Wolovick, Two Way Monologues), this 6-piece powerhouse melds Bohemian Klezmer Punk with pop sensibilities into an eminently danceable party. The diversity of musicians that make up Bella's Bartok, combined with their boundless energy on stage, has been known to break a dancefloor, or two (or three, but who's counting?). Their sound moves way beyond labels, pushing the envelope towards the darker side of Eastern European music, referencing vaudeville and 20th century eclecticism. \nThe Bella's Bartok line-up includes: Asher Putnam (Vocals and all-around entertainer), Chris \"Fancy\" Kerrigan (Guitar, Clarinet, Vocals), Dan Niederhauser (Bass and Vocals), Amory Drennan (Trombone/Banjo and Vocals), Crisco (Drums/Percussion and Trumpet) and Gershon Rosen (trumpet). The band has shared the stage with musicians and acts such as Rubblebucket, Red Baraat, The Indigo Girls, Larry & His Flask, The Suitcase Junket, Parsonsfield, And the Kids, Kanye, Rough Francis, Beau Sasser\u2019s Escape Plan, West End Blend, Adam Ezra Group, Meat Puppets, World Inferno/Friendship Society, Rupa & the April Fishes, Arc Iris, and many more.\nWith multiple awards under their belts, including The Valley Advocate's Best Band in the Valley 2014 and The Deli Magazine's Best of New England (twice!), this eclectic group of guys have carefully crafted a sound that is part strange and creepy, part pop gold. With an aura of theatricality, Bella's Bartok shows not only entertain, but they invite you to partake in the wild party they are having on stage, to involve yourself in the spectacle. Quite simply put- this is the band you should never miss, ever.\n\nTigerman WOAH - Lynn, Massachusetts \nhttp://tigermanwoah.com/\n\nDrunken, cultish, group-work-oriented, always woah singin\nwith TOO MUCH HEART", "start_time": "2017-12-09T21:00:00-0500", "priority": "9", "place": {"id": "39434788737", "name": "Waterhole", "location": {"city": "Saranac Lake", "zip": "12983", "country": "United States", "longitude": -74.13151, "state": "NY", "street": "48 Main St", "latitude": 44.32569}}, "end_time": "2017-12-10T02:00:00-0500", "id": "161636544422079", "name": "The Odd Ball SAT Blind Owl Band Bella's Bartok Tigerman Woah"}
