{"description": "$10 Adv/$15 DOS / Age 18 And Up\n\nAdditional Info:\nThe seeds of Dirty Blanket were planted in 2013 at the meeting of lead guitarist Max \"Dirty\" Flansburg and lead singer/songwriter Kevin \"Blanket\" O'Leary. Combining an array of unique musical influences with a shared passion for creating new original music, the two began playing as an acoustic duo. Utilizing what free time their other musical projects allowed to book gigs across Upstate NY, they eventually found themselves opening for acts as large as Jeff Austin of the Yonder Mountain String Band and beyond. The summer of 2016 saw the duo's sound take a shift toward a more heavily bluegrass-influenced style, with Max and Kevin crafting new originals and taking to the stage to cover the music of such Americana legends as Hot Rize, Newgrass Revival, the Del McCoury Band, and the like.Root SHOCK was formed in Winter of 2012 with veteran musicians whose love of reggae music flows deep. Blending roots reggae, dancehall, heavy drum & bass and soulful vocals with conscious lyrics into positive dance music will make you want to move!\nTickets:\nhttp://www.ticketweb.com/event/dirty-blanket-and-root-shock-funk-n-waffles-music-hall-tickets/7852505?REFERRAL_ID=twfb", "start_time": "2017-12-31T21:00:00-0500", "priority": "9", "place": {"id": "86659589746", "name": "Funk 'n Waffles Rochester", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14604", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.61141, "state": "NY", "street": "204 N Water St", "latitude": 43.16048}}, "id": "2149887625036940", "name": "New Year\u2019s w/ Dirty Blanket and Root Shock"}
