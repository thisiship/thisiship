{"description": "Steve Mizek & Savile stand in the ranks of a resurgent\nunderground in American dance music. The pair co-manage\nArgot and Tasteful Nudes, the former of which focuses on\nNorth American-based artists, while Nudes\u2019 roster explores\nmore international talent.\n\nAs DJs, they cover a breadth of genres and moods, priding\nthemselves on an open-ended approach to selection that\nflouts expectation. Endlessly challenging one another to\npush beyond their comfort zones, you might hear a ballroom\nclassic flirting with 90\u2019s Synewave, or a sly pop hit nestled\nagainst a Chicago jack track. In 2016, they crisscrossed the\nUnited States, from LA to New York and between, and were\ninvited to Europe for the first time to debut at the legendary\nPanorama Bar.\n\nAs label managers, they are tireless champions of the\nbudding voices behind their releases. Reinforced by Mizek\u2019s\nlongstanding search for the best electronic music has to\noffer as editor-in-chief of Little White Earbuds, Argot and\nTasteful Nudes have showcased many important voices since\ntheir inception, including the Black Madonna, Royer, Amir\nAlexander, and Gunnar Haslam.\n\n<<< DJ LINEUP >>>\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSteve Mizek  \n[Argot I Tasteful Nudes I CHI]\n\nSavile \n[Argot I Smart Bar I CHI]\n\nRob Morley\n[S>N | ROC]\n\nJim Kempkes\n[S>N I ROC]\n\n<<< PARTY ESSENTIALS >>>\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSaturday > DEC 9\nRochester > NY\n[10PM - 4AM] \n21+ w/ID\n\nLights By : Gnosis\nPowered By : JWI", "start_time": "2017-12-09T22:00:00-0500", "priority": "9", "place": {"id": "768319583287478", "name": "Photo City Improv: Comedy & Music Venue", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14609", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.569275, "state": "NY", "street": "543 Atlantic Ave", "latitude": 43.156315}}, "end_time": "2017-12-10T04:00:00-0500", "id": "345717299187948", "name": "Signal > Noise :: v3.3 : Steve Mizek + Savile"}
