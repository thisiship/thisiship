{"description": "Anthony Gallacchio, a.k.a. Tony G, was rumored to have been born playing a Moog.  We are not sure if that is true, but we are also not going to doubt it.  \n\nHe is one of the premiere keys guys in Western NY and is a member of Giant Panda.  When he gets some time off, he gets down with some serious funk, and that is what is going to be happening at this event.  \n\nHe is going to get a couple of buddies to come down and throw a funky dance party for all of you.  \n\nCome on down, drink some beers, dance and celebrate all that is good in the world.  \n\nDoors 7\nMusic 8\n$5\n\nEvent photo by Aaron Winters", "start_time": "2017-11-25T19:00:00-0500", "priority": "9", "place": {"id": "126843517347072", "name": "Three Heads Brewing", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14607", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.57965, "state": "NY", "street": "186 Atlantic Ave", "latitude": 43.15675}}, "end_time": "2017-11-25T23:00:00-0500", "id": "295817580921765", "name": "Tony G's Funky Holiday Spectacular"}
