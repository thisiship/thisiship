The group jams, but it isn't a jam band. It circles psychedelic rock, but doesn't get lost in the ether. It's a rock 'n' roll band that doesn't adhere to merely the one, the four, and the five. It's odd, but not intentionally obtuse....\" - Frank DeBlase\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCosmic Brownie is an electronic/funk infused hip-hop duo from Rochester, NY, comprised of MC, Clayboy Spoons, and DJ/multi-instrumentalist, Abe Froman.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nStereo Nest uses the singular human mind as the central processor between thought, freely controlled looping machines, and electric guitar. Live creations of electronic sounds move amorphous within a non-mechanical format, bleeding life into the circuitry, aiming for symbiosis between man and machine.", "start_time": "2017-11-22T20:00:00-0500", "priority": "9", "place": {"id": "86659589746", "name": "Funk 'n Waffles Rochester", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14604", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.61141, "state": "NY", "street": "204 N Water St", "latitude": 43.16048}}, "id": "141033549956488", "name": "Funksgiving!
