{"description": "Upward Groove is a band that has been taking the scene by storm.  They have an upbeat sound and are fronted by our good buddy you might recognize from behind the bar, Eli Flynn.  \n\nGreat hooks, incredible rhythms and vocals for days...plus 16 taps of delicious beers.  This will be the spot to be.  You will dance and burn off all the calories you took in the day before.  \n\nWe will also be tapping our final kegs of Baltic Porter and Iron Smoke Whiskey Barrel Aged Porter for the day.  \n\nSmokin' Hot Chicks BBQ and Catering will be here serving food.  \n\nLet's celebrate.  \n\nEvent photo by Empire West Photo", "start_time": "2017-11-24T19:05:00-0500", "priority": "9", "place": {"id": "126843517347072", "name": "Three Heads Brewing", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14607", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.57965, "state": "NY", "street": "186 Atlantic Ave", "latitude": 43.15675}}, "end_time": "2017-11-24T23:00:00-0500", "id": "125469171549820", "name": "Upward Groove at Three Heads"}
