E.N started playing piano at age 6, which was the beginning of his musical life. His parents bought him a white upright Samick Piano that he still records and plays on today. At age 12, he broke his left arm and the doctor recommended some physical activity to help recover. In response, his father bought him a drum set to help with his recovery. Not only did it help physically but E.N found a passion for percussion and drums. With his new drumming talent, he reinvented himself on the piano and his musical world was revealed. \n\nReggae music has always been a part of E.N Young's life. Growing up with his brothers, Manuel and Mike'Chunky Roots' Marquez, reggae was around and the influence was strong. Daily, E.N and his brothers would search for the next reggae tune that caught their ears and lose themselves within the reggae vibes. Now, E.N is more involved in the reggae scene than ever imagined. Not only has he established a name for himself as an individual artist but also as a writer and producer.\n\nE.N started performing when he was 15 years old and in 2002 he became a member of the band Stranger. As a band they put out four studio albums and toured on the West coast, including Guam and Hawaii; which led them to win the San Diego Music Award in 2009. In 2005, E.N Young met Bonita/Chula Vista locals, Roots Covenant. They played the strongest and most authentic roots reggae sound on the West coast and backed 30+ Jamaican artists. In 2010 E.N began pushing his solo career by releasing his first debut album \u2018Luck & Chance No More\u2019 under his new label, Roots Musician Records; he became the first artist under RMR and began to tour as a solo artist.

From Hawaii to New York, E.N Young completed a fall national tour as the opening artist for Tribal Seeds. A year after that E.N officially joined Tribal Seeds,playing keyboard, melodica and singing.\n\nConstruction of E.N\u2019s studio, Imperial Sound Recording Studio took place in August of 2012 and was completed in January of 2013. Imperial Sound is the most southwest recording studio in the United States; bordering Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. It was a dream that has manifested into a professional recording studio.

Some of those bands include: Tribal Seeds, High Tide, HIRIE, K Bong, Beyond I Sight, Gonzo, Inna Vision, Clear Conscience and Without Papers.
