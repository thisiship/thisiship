The result has become a fiery exhibition of artfully conceived dance music that truly is Big and Mean. Today, BMSM comprises a collective of over 15 analog artists spread out over the Northeastern United States, who strive day in and day out to reanimate and reinterpret a fusion of Afrobeat, Funk, Jazz, Latin and many other styles, all through a postmodern lens. Anyone who has witnessed The Machine live in action knows that their performances are among the heaviest and the sweatiest. Anyone who has heard their studio releases also knows that they can refine this complex sonic force with maturity and clarity that allows each composition to blossom to its fullest. As of January 2013, their performative efforts have extended to the big screen as well. With the release of DR. IGUANA: LIVE IN THE STUDIO, a live DVD shot at Grammy Award-winning studio Electric Wilburland, Big Mean Sound Machine adds more critical acclaim to that received from their CD releases Marauders (2012), and Ouroboros (2011). In addition, in 2012 Big Mean released Warrior, a joint effort with vocalist Jay Spaker a.k.a. J-SAN (John Brown's Body, JATAS), and in 2013, the band released an album with Ghana's Yao Foli \"Cha Cha\" Augustine (Mosaic Foundation, The Ndor Band) supporting the Ndor Eco Village project in Foli's home village. Recently, BMSM digitally released the single \"In the Name of What?\" to promote their upcoming studio album \"Contraband\" which was tracked live and is due to be released May 31st, 2014 on vinyl, and CD (Angry Mom Records) as well as digitally.
