The story tells of Emmet Otter and his Ma, a widow who scrapes by on the small amount of money she gets from doing laundry and from Emmet doing odd jobs around their hometown of Frogtown Hollow. As Christmas approaches, they hear of a talent contest in the nearby town of Waterville, and separately decide to enter so that if they win, they can afford to buy nice presents for each other-a nice guitar for Emmet, or a piano for Ma. However, in a twist on \"The Gift of the Magi\", they must sacrifice each other's livelihood for their performances (Ma hocks Emmet's tools to buy dress fabric while Emmet turns Ma's washtub into a washtub bass for a jug band). The film features several amazing songs written by songwriter Paul Williams, who'd previously worked with Jim Henson on The Muppet Show and would go on to write all the songs for The Muppet Movie and The Muppet Christmas Carol; however, many fans agree that the music of Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas was the best work of his career.\nTickets:\nhttp://www.ticketweb.com/fb/7841605/lovincup", "start_time": "2017-12-03T14:00:00-0500", "priority": "9", "place": {"id": "143806965652986", "name": "Lovin' Cup", "location": {"city": "Rochester", "zip": "14623", "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.656892912435, "state": "NY", "street": "300 Park Point Drive", "latitude": 43.0917479}}, "id": "546732865667532", "name": "The Music of Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas (and other Jim Henson favo..."}
