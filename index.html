                                        <p> Upward Groove is a band that has been taking the scene by storm.  They have an upbeat sound and are fronted by our good buddy you might recognize from behind the bar, Eli Flynn.  

Great hooks, incredible rhythms and vocals for days...plus 16 taps of delicious beers.  This will be the spot to be.  You will dance and burn off all the calories you took in the day before.  

Let's celebrate.

                                        <p> Dirty Blanket returns to The Station.  James Searl and Dylan Savage from Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad will be sitting in during the set.  Please check back for more details.

The seeds of Dirty Blanket were planted in 2013 at the meeting of lead guitarist Max "Dirty" Flansburg and lead singer/songwriter Kevin "Blanket" O'Leary. Combining an array of unique musical influences with a shared passion for creating new original music, the two began playing as an acoustic duo. Utilizing what free time their other musical projects allowed to book gigs across Upstate NY, they eventually found themselves opening for acts as large as Jeff Austin of the Yonder Mountain String Band and beyond. The summer of 2016 saw the duo's sound take a shift toward a more heavily bluegrass-influenced style, with Max and Kevin crafting new originals and taking to the stage to cover the music of such Americana legends as Hot Rize, Newgrass Revival, the Del McCoury Band, and the like.
In the months that followed, the two were joined by longtime friends Richie Colf on the mandolin, and Joel Fedkiw on the five string banjo. By December of 2016, local Finger Lakes musician Aaron Oldweiler had joined the ranks on upright bass, rounding out the band as a 5-piece, fast-picking bluegrass quintet. The group continues to garner the attention of folk music lovers and festival goers from the Finger Lakes Region and across Upstate NY.

                                        <p> The English Project are releasing their long awaited CD.  Since the beginning of Three Heads, Chris English has been one of our biggest musical supporters.  He has played every Homegrown we have thrown and most of our big events.  There is a simple reason why....he is amazing.  

Now with the English Project, he has surrounded himself with a crew of incredibly talented musicians and they are about to take the scene by storm.  Playing funk, soul, gospel, groove and rock, the music will make you need to dance.  

Come help us support one of favorites.

This is going to be an experience that will be memorable and we are honoroed to have the crew come down for one of our classic Not Sucking With Style Thursday shows.  

This is going to be a fun one.

John Brown's Body
www.johnbrownsbody.com
Together for two decades and hailed as “Future roots, reggae, and dub with an intricately balanced weaving of vocals, percussion, keyboard, bass, guitar, and stunning 3-piece horn section that ties it all together” (WRUV), John Brown’s Body (JBB) is building “a legacy that has inspired and carved a path for the now thriving contemporary American reggae scene” (Rudeboy Reggae). Formed in Ithaca, New York, in the mid 1990s, at a time when there wasn’t yet a far-reaching U.S. reggae scene, JBB was one of a small handful of U.S. reggae bands that began touring nationally. Since then, JBB has played an important role in helping define distinctly “American reggae.” JBB’s music is steeped in traditional vibes, but unapologetically incorporates elements from other genres. While most American reggae bands tackled typical reggae themes (such as religion and marijuana), JBB acted more like an indie band, writing songs that used the vocabulary of reggae to express their own experiences. Their unique approach resonated with the masses. The group’s 2008 full-length record, Amplify, hit #1 on the Billboard Reggae Chart, 2012’s JBB In Dub EP reached #1 on iTunes’ Reggae Chart, and in 2013 Kings And Queens topped both Billboard and iTunes Reggae Charts at #1. Today, JBB’s signature style has become the norm for U.S. reggae bands - and many in the genre admittedly point to John Brown’s Body as a key influence. </p>

                                        <p> Full of energy and surprise, wit and subtlety, Twisted Pine has quickly become one of the most acclaimed young string bands in the Northeast. Audiences across the US and UK have been drawn to their forthright songwriting, lush harmonies, musical daring, and “charismatic appeal,” to quote Grammy-winner Alison Brown.

"Hold On Me," displays everything that is wonderful about Twisted Pine: an upbeat, poppy vibe; energetic, driving rhythms; virtuosic solos; tight harmonies. This is definitely a band to watch!" - NPR

"The bluegrass quartet (thought strictly referring to them as such may be an understatement) are following in the path of acts like Punch Brothers and others mixing the traditional with the slightly more virtuosic and varied. Each member of this band is a runaway freight train of talent on their own, but together the jubilance of sound they unleash on a crowd is something to be marveled." - Red Line Roots

"Twisted Pine is one of the most original-sounding groups ever to take up bluegrass instruments. They absolutely rule their musical world with humor and relish. If Billy Joel had been the father of Bluegrass instead of that other Bill, everyone might all sound like these folks." - Darol Anger, fiddler </p>

                                        <p> We love playing in Naples, and we really love playing at Roots Cafe - but it's tough to fit all of us and all of you and then still find room to groove!  So, we will be stripping things down a bit for a another rare "unplugged" set.  We only do this a couple times a year, but they are always a blast and we could not think of a better setting.  Hope to see you there! </p>

Driftwood
www.driftwoodtheband.com
When most people think of upstate New York, they either imagine bucolic landscapes or working-class towns. As natives of Binghamton, the members of Driftwood hail from a working town, but play music rooted in the land, leaning alternately into folk, old-time, country, punk, and rock, depending on their personal moods and their songs' needs.

"It's sometimes tough to keep any sort of focus on style or sound when you have three different songwriters," guitarist Dan Forsyth concedes. "But it also allows us to branch out and explore in ways other bands don't. Also, I think it's important, as a band, to ask ourselves 'Is this a good next step?' I think everyone is very excited to know that it is." Describing the Driftwood sound, banjo player Joe Kollar offers, "I consider our sound to be more of an attitude and an approach - the result of all of our influences in a completely open musical forum where the only stipulation is to use bluegrass instruments and create it from the heart."

That's as close to being pinned down as Driftwood ever gets. Such has always been the case for artists blurring and blending genre lines in order to innovate. Yes, they wield old-time instruments, but they do so with a punk-rock ethos. "I do not know much about punk music, but I do know that it gives me a feeling of tearing into something without inhibition," violinist Claire Byrne says, adding, "Old-time music has the same feeling for me. The music was a release for people living extremely hard lives in harsh conditions. In this way, the two styles of music are very similar: It's digging in and making a statement. It's rocking out and feeling totally reborn through the song."

Driftwood has been digging in and rocking out since their 2005 formation, playing an average of 150 shows a year. "In the beginning, we hit the road constantly with an all-or-nothing attitude," Forsyth confides. "We were doing it with a lot of passion, but had no thoughts about long-term sustainability. Life outside of the band was minimal. One thing that I think we started to notice was, when you're always in it, you have no perspective and you start to lose yourself in a weird way."

As such, gigging and traveling that much can't help but influence and inform the band, individually and collectively. In the past, they used the stage to work out arrangements of new songs. For City Lights, they used the studio. "Keeping this kind of touring schedule, we have thought of recording albums as a sort of secondary thing and considered ourselves a 'live' band. We learn so much on the road and this kind of work has always felt productive," Forsyth explains. "It wasn't until this last album that we took some time off to learn more about being in the studio. We wanted to take our time and record on our own terms."

According to Byrne, their own terms included "taking a step forward with the production and the arrangements." Kollar tacks "learning" on, for good measure, while Forsyth adds "good songs and bigger arrangements, and sounds than we had not previously achieved."

Even though they come from different directions, the three founding members - along with bassist Joey Arcuri - tend to end up at the same place. That unity, as well as the joy derived from playing together, can be heard throughout City Lights.

As further evidence of their compatibility, both Forsyth and Byrne tag "Skin and Bone" as the head of the album. It's a Kollar composition that he says "came from a reflection I had of myself and life on the road, in general. It touches on trying to keep perspective, forging ahead, and embracing the future." Clearly, that's a state of mind they can all relate to.

The heart of the album, though, is a toss up with Forsyth choosing the romance of "Too Afraid," Byrne picking the nostalgia of "The Waves," and Kollar tapping the excitement of the title track. That disparity may be because, in their decade together, the musicians have all undergone monumental life changes. They have come into their own... together. Forsyth is now a husband and father; Byrne is now a recorded songwriter. "Generally speaking, there's a maturity to us now," Kollar explains. "We have a bit of experience doing what we do and the music reflects that point of view. The song subjects, our playing/singing abilities, our recording abilities, and our relationships have all matured."

Forsyth picks up the thread, "We have all learned an unbelievable amount of patience and teamwork strategy. Our band is close: Everyone knows a lot about each other. We travel in very tight quarters constantly and are always up on what's happening in each others' lives. I think this has really enabled us to express ourselves, individually and as a group, but also to understand each other and others in so many ways."

Having joined Driftwood when she was 21, Byrne has spent her whole adult life in the band "learning to play and sing in a group, learning the art of performance, and, of course, learning who I am and what my purpose(s) in life are. I think you can hear those changes from the first record to the last one." Because City Lights marks her songwriting debut, she feels like her personal growth is on full display. "Rather than just listening to my harmonies and fiddle playing, you now have lyrics, as well. I think the songs I have on this record reflect a woman going through a great shift in her life, settling down a bit, and reflecting on the many different ways that affects me and my relationships with others."

As the sole woman of the band, Byrne puts a clearly different spin on things. "Sometimes, instead of thinking about adding a feminine perspective, I actually spend time thinking about how to make myself fit in with the guys and, therefore, dumbing down my femininity a bit," she says. "With my songwriting, though, there is no hiding it. I'm talking about things from a woman's perspective that many other women will be able to relate to easier than they would if a man was writing and singing about the same topics."

One topic the three songwriters all agree on is home. In their own ways, they each love and reflect their hard-scrabble hometown. "Growing up in the Chenango Bridge/Binghamton area, I never really thought about it being an economically depressed town. To me, it was a perfect balance of rivers, woods, campfires, street signs, factories, and city lights," Kollar says, referencing the new album's title. "Now, I know a little more about it being a post-industrial town, but still I see it as a diamond in the rough. I relate to the sort of underdog/uphill feel of the town."

Byrne adds, "I think coming from a place such as Binghamton makes us very raw. We are a reflection of where we grew up. There isn't really anything fancy about us - we aren't the 'hippest' group out there, as far as fashion goes - but we are certainly very real. What you see is what you get."

Milkweed
https://www.milkweedtheband.com/home
 Milkweed is a band that was born on Main Street in the quiet post industrial city of Binghamton NY.  It is the collaboration of three artists - Joseph Alston, Jacqualine Colombo and Peter Lister.  Without committing to one genre Milkweed has pulled from many of the great aspects of American music and created their own brand of American song and story telling.  Whether it is blue grass guitar flat picking, Chicago blues harmonica, Irish ballads or Jersey shore folk songs, Milkweed weaves together the sounds that make up the rich tapestry of American music history. With their lyrics they set themselves apart from the norm, taking the simple stories of everyday people and telling them through the lens of dreams and what it means to be a human.  The root of the bands sound is in the use of three part harmony to impart a sense of importance and depth to their lyrics that brings the listener into their songs and feel invested in it.

Milkweeds debut full length album, Dream of An American Family, was released in November of 2015.  It consists of thirteen original songs ranging from fingerpicking ballads, up tempo picking tunes, to a piedmont blues inspired song.  It was recorded by Don Sternecker at the great Mixolydian Studios and was crafted to be like the great folk albums of the past, predominantly live and in front of great microphones.  Songs from the album have received praise and radio play throughout the Northeast and East Coast and has gotten Milkweed onto larger theater and festival stages over the last year.  Upon the arrival of a new tour van the band has been on the road  prolifically, playing more then 160 shows a year.  With the advent of a new album close at hand, longer tours booked nationally and collaborations with other musicians, Milkweed shows no sign of slowing down. </p>

Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad
http://livepanda.com/

Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad’s sixth studio album MAKE IT BETTER was released September 16, 2016 on Rootfire Cooperative. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard Reggae Chart.
 
Formed in 2001 in Rochester, New York, GPGDS first received praise for their live show, which combined world beats and reggae rhythms within jamband aesthetics. In recent years the band’s studio recordings, which showcase their songwriting and musicianship across all genres of roots music, have further cemented their legend as master innovators and artists. “There is a lot of intention in this release. We had a purpose to prove to ourselves recording this album [MAKE IT BETTER]. We wanted to know that we could put our heads down and do good work fast. It was a great release artistically. It uniquely sounds the most progressive of anything we have ever done while also sounding the most like our first album.” -James Searl, Bassist/Vocalist

Aaron Lipp & The Slack Tones

While wielding sweet-toned electric guitar, groove hungry upright bass slapping, rock solid drumming and a screaming fiddle, the Slack Tones will help you find yourself in a 1950's rockabilly club mixed with dead-on bluegrass flatpicking and new original songwriting. With their new record featuring Oliver Wood of The Wood Brothers on one of the tracks, Aaron Lipp & The Slack Tones are kicking the season off right. If you enjoy mind-bending guitar riffs over infectious old school rockabilly rhythms with original songwriting about today's times and troubles, you won't be disappointed!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

E.N Young born Ian Allan Young, is a roots musician born and raised on the USA/Mexico border in San Diego, California. E.N started playing piano at age 6, which was the beginning of his musical life. His parents bought him a white upright Samick Piano that he still records and plays on today. At age 12, he broke his left arm and the doctor recommended some physical activity to help recover. In response, his father bought him a drum set to help with his recovery. Not only did it help physically but E.N found a passion for percussion and drums. With his new drumming talent, he reinvented himself on the piano and his musical world was revealed. 

Reggae music has always been a part of E.N Young's life. Growing up with his brothers, Manuel and Mike'Chunky Roots' Marquez, reggae was around and the influence was strong. Daily, E.N and his brothers would search for the next reggae tune that caught their ears and lose themselves within the reggae vibes. Now, E.N is more involved in the reggae scene than ever imagined. Not only has he established a name for himself as an individual artist but also as a writer and producer.

E.N started performing when he was 15 years old and in 2002 he became a member of the band Stranger. As a band they put out four studio albums and toured on the West coast, including Guam and Hawaii; which led them to win the San Diego Music Award in 2009. In 2005, E.N Young met Bonita/Chula Vista locals, Roots Covenant. They played the strongest and most authentic roots reggae sound on the West coast and backed 30+ Jamaican artists. In 2010 E.N began pushing his solo career by releasing his first debut album ‘Luck & Chance No More’ under his new label, Roots Musician Records; he became the first artist under RMR and began to tour as a solo artist. Along his musical path, he has played onstage with many influential reggae artists including Quino Big Mountain, Devastators, Johnny Clarke, Triston Palma, Sammy Dread, Heptones, Everton Blender, Jah Batta, Michael Palma, Sister Nancy, Edi Fitzroy, Anuhea, Tamarama, Stranger, Carlton Livingston, Don Carlos, Slightly Stoopid, the Abyssinians, Clear Conscience, Eek A Mouse, English Man, Gonzo, Tribal Seeds, Milton Henry and more.

In May 2011, E.N went into studio with Tribal Seeds to produce their new EP ‘SoundWaves.’ The EP was released in July and received world-wide attention. From Hawaii to New York, E.N Young completed a fall national tour as the opening artist for Tribal Seeds. A year after that E.N officially joined Tribal Seeds,playing keyboard, melodica and singing.

Construction of E.N’s studio, Imperial Sound Recording Studio took place in August of 2012 and was completed in January of 2013. Imperial Sound is the most southwest recording studio in the United States; bordering Mexico and the Pacific Ocean. It was a dream that has manifested into a professional recording studio. The doors to Imperial Sound were officially opened on January 2, 2013. As soon as the studio was ready bands began to come through the studio to record some great records. Some of those bands include: Tribal Seeds, High Tide, HIRIE, K Bong, Beyond I Sight, Gonzo, Inna Vision, Clear Conscience and Without Papers. Imperial Sound Recording Studio is located near the Imperial Beach in sunny San Diego, California.

E.N Young is continuing to make sweet reggae music in his studio producing tracks for several bands and Roots Musician Records signed artists, including Gonzo, Leilani Wolfgramm, Tatanka, Mystic Roots Band, Clear Conscience, Revival, Animo, Inna Vision and Skanks Roots projects. He released his sophomore album ‘Live, Love, Stay Up’ in January of 2015 which consisted of 27 tracks including acoustic and dub versions. The album featured Tribal Seeds, Maad T-Ray (Of Tribal Seeds), Kali Navales and Jah Gumby (of Ooklah The Moc) and Gonzo. E.N recently released his newest album ‘Call On Me’ in April 2016 with it debuting at #3 on Itunes reggae charts. To E.N Young, ‘Call On Me’ is his most artistic and free album so far and he believes it will be a bridge for new reggae listeners as well as a continuing foundation for roots lovers. E.N Young's main goal continues to be, to travel the world spreading good through music and inspiring others. </p>
