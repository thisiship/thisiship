Richie and Rosie
http://richieandrosie.com/
Richie Stearns and Rosie Newton grew up 150 miles and a few decades apart. Having originally met at Saratoga Springs’ Flurry festival, the two reunited in the Ithaca old-time scene, where Richie grew up and Rosie had moved for college. During Rosie’s freshman year, they began touring together regionally as members of the Evil City String Band and eventually decided to pursue a more intimate project as a duo. In 2013 the duo released their first album, Tractor Beam, a 12-track mix of originals and classics, designed to mirror the experience of a live performance.
 
After three years of touring and writing, Richie and Rosie returned to the studio last December to record their second full-length album, Nowhere in Time. Set for release November 10, 2017, the record finds itself at a junction of Americana, old-time, and folk, bringing a new sound to traditional music. Recorded with producer Alex Perialas at Pyramid Sound Studios, the project gives fans a look inside the band’s personal lives with a variety of introspective lyrics. With singles like, “Honey Bee”, “No Longer Lonely”, and title-track, “Nowhere in Time,” the album highlights the incredibly-refined skill of both musicians. 
            
            Before joining forces, both members were well-established within the old-time community. Rosie has toured with multiple bands, including an appearance while she was in high school with folk-rock band The Mammals. In 2010, she released a self-titled album as part of the duo The Pearly Snaps. In addition to releasing two solo albums, Richie’s discography includes collaborations with Natalie Merchant, Jim Lauderdale, Donna the Buffalo, and Carrie Rodriguez. He has performed internationally with bands like Bela Fleck, Pete Seeger, David Byrne, Billy Bragg & Wilco, Old Crow Medicine Show, and Joan Baez. He is the President of the iconic GrassRoots Festival of Music & Dance.
 
With the fated combination of Richie and Rosie’s unique skill, varied musical influence, and honest storytelling, Nowhere in Time defines exactly what the duo hopes to achieve -- music that people can connect with. As two musicians in two very different parts of life, Richie and Rosie are proof of two things: the power and magic of two people making music, and that the universal messages that lie within their songs remain timeless. </p>

The Medicinals have had a pretty fun 2017 thus far having opened up for such national acts as the Wailers (twice), and Turkuaz, as well as sharing the stage with the legendary Majestics, and regional favorites Root Shock, Noble Vibes, and the Crucial Reggae Social Club to name a few.  In addition we have also had the distinct pleasure of debuting at the Lilac Festival, Sterling Stage’s Ameribeat as well as the Genesee Park Point Concert Series.

For our next hometown show we are continuing this trend and adding onto this roster of inspirational friends in a very special way as we are very excited to announce that we will be bringing Kevin Kinsella (founder of John Brown's Body & 10 Foot Ganja Plant) with his new band "Bead N’ Bone" here to share the stage with us all night long. 

To make the night truly complete we have also invited our great friend Dj 2-Way (Level 7 Experience) to be the house selector on decks for the entire night.

Hakeem Dodley will be the Medicinals FOH engineer for the entire set.

This show will be The Medicinals last hometown hit of 2017 before we get back into the studio to rehearse and record for 2018 so we truly hope you all can roll through with your respective crews and dance the night away with us. </p>

                                        <p> Upward Groove is a band that has been taking the scene by storm.  They have an upbeat sound and are fronted by our good buddy you might recognize from behind the bar, Eli Flynn.  

Great hooks, incredible rhythms and vocals for days...plus 16 taps of delicious beers.  This will be the spot to be.  You will dance and burn off all the calories you took in the day before.  

We will also be tapping our final kegs of Baltic Porter and Iron Smoke Whiskey Barrel Aged Porter for the day.  

Smokin' Hot Chicks BBQ and Catering will be here serving food.  

Let's celebrate.

                                        <p> Anthony Gallacchio, a.k.a. Tony G, was rumored to have been born playing a Moog.  We are not sure if that is true, but we are also not going to doubt it.  

He is one of the premiere keys guys in Western NY and is a member of Giant Panda.  When he gets some time off, he gets down with some serious funk, and that is what is going to be happening at this event.  

He is going to get a couple of buddies to come down and throw a funky dance party for all of you.  

Come on down, drink some beers, dance and celebrate all that is good in the world.

Last Roc Soil show of 2017!

The Palmer Squares: What originally began as an inside joke among high school friends, unexpectedly morphed into a legitimate hip-hop duo that has now garnered praise from some of the most respected veterans in the game. One day after school, despite never having the urge to pen a verse before, Acumental and Term conspired among themselves to poke fun at the prevailing trends. After sharing these ridiculous parodies with their close friends, they were showered with the anticipated laughs, but also received an overwhelming, unexpected response they could have never foreseen: "write more; this is amazing!" Thus, The Palmer Squares were born.

Subsoil: Subsoil is lyric-driven live Hip-Hop music. Known for high-energy live shows, and a keen-edge of razor-sharp lyricism, with equal emphasis on tight grooves and furious improvisations. These traits have earned the band the award for "Best Live Act" in 2010 from the Rochester NY's "Insider-Metromix Magazine" and Subsoil has gained a fan base all over the upstate NY region by their relentless touring throughout the years.

JAZZ IS PHSH is an instrumental tribute to Phish inspired by the popular tribute to The Grateful Dead, “Jazz is Dead”. JAZZ IS PHSH is a collective of prominent musicians from the Jazz and Jam scenes that have come together in their appreciation of Phish music to reimagine Phish in an instrumental, jazz fusion setting!

Founded in 2015 by The Chase Brothers, Adam Chase and Matthew Chase, JAZZ IS PHSH has quickly become a world renown tribute to Phish, attracting some of the most influential musicians in the jazz and jam scenes to take part in this collective approach to paying tribute to one of the most important and influential bands in Rock and Roll history. </p>

Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad
http://livepanda.com/

Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad’s sixth studio album MAKE IT BETTER was released September 16, 2016 on Rootfire Cooperative. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard Reggae Chart.
 
Formed in 2001 in Rochester, New York, GPGDS first received praise for their live show, which combined world beats and reggae rhythms within jamband aesthetics. In recent years the band’s studio recordings, which showcase their songwriting and musicianship across all genres of roots music, have further cemented their legend as master innovators and artists. “There is a lot of intention in this release. We had a purpose to prove to ourselves recording this album [MAKE IT BETTER]. We wanted to know that we could put our heads down and do good work fast. It was a great release artistically. It uniquely sounds the most progressive of anything we have ever done while also sounding the most like our first album.” -James Searl, Bassist/Vocalist

Aaron Lipp & The Slack Tones
https://aaronlipp.com
While wielding sweet-toned electric guitar, groove hungry upright bass slapping, rock solid drumming and a screaming fiddle, the Slack Tones will help you find yourself in a 1950's rockabilly club mixed with dead-on bluegrass flatpicking and new original songwriting. With their new record featuring Oliver Wood of The Wood Brothers on one of the tracks, Aaron Lipp & The Slack Tones are kicking the season off right. If you enjoy mind-bending guitar riffs over infectious old school rockabilly rhythms with original songwriting about today's times and troubles, you won't be disappointed!

West End Blend - Hartford, CT
Soul/Funk
http://www.westendblend.com/

Bio:
Since their conception, Funk/Soul band West End Blend has been playing their version of Funk and Soul in venues all over the Northeast. Fronted by vocalist Erica Bryan, the band pays homage to classic throwback sounds while adding their own distinct vibe and flair. Behind her, the Blend packs a four-piece horn section, two guitars, bass, keyboards and drums onto stages every night. From humble beginnings in an epic sweaty funky basement dance party, the Blend’s goal has always been to bring that same atmosphere to every show ever since. 

The Blend released their debut full length record, “Rewind”, in the Fall of 2015. The album was recorded at Telefunken Studios with Grammy Award winning engineer, Brendan Morawski. Alongside their album release, West End Blend shared the stage with Turkuaz, Break Science, Kung Fu, Twiddle, Sister Sparrow & the Dirty Birds, The Nth Power, The Motet and countless others Jam/Funk staples throughout 2015-2016. On September 28th, 2016 the Blend released their latest EP “Say Hey!” as they embarked on their Fall Tour across the Northeast. Throughout their Fall tour they shared the stage with Dopapod, The Nth Power, Turkuaz, Hayley Jane & The Primates, Deep Banana Blackout and more. </p>

Based out of Western NY, the English Project has solidified itself in the North Eastern U.S. as a collective that pushes the envelope of groove and  improvisation. Comprised of core members Chris English on drums and vocals, Paul McArdle on guitar, Andres Rivera on bass and Dave Solazzo on piano, the English Project seamlessly fuses funk and soul with elements of modern jazz. They’ve also opened for artists such as Bobby Brown, Arrested Development, Jazz is Phsh, Giant Panda Guerrilla Dub Squad, Sophistafunk, Thunderbody, John Kadlecik Band, and many others. </p>

                                        <p> Thursday December 14th - After Funk Holiday Throwdown w/ Root Shock
Doors: 8:00pm, Show: 9:00pm - Tickets: $7 ADV/$10 DOS - Ages: 18+
________________________________________________

After Funk is a fun filled, soul driven, funk-rock explosion.
Hailed as “The grooviest band north of the border” (Live for Live Music), the Toronto based funk family have been blazing a trail through the North American music scene leaving only happy hearts and dancing feet in their wake. The combination of Yanick Allwood (keyboards & vocals), Jaime Rosenberg (drums), Justin Bontje (bass) and Phil Tessis (guitar) results in an infectiously fun show, as well as virtuosity and beauty that will challenge your musical mind.

After Funk’s sound and hard work has not gone unnoticed; being selected as the Electric Forest’s Instrumental Forester in 2014 earned them two sets at the festival and they have served as support for Walk Off The Earth, Lettuce, Snarky Puppy, Dumpstaphunk, TAUK and more.
The band has released 2 albums to help you prepare for the experience: ‘Til The Sun Comes Up features Canadian hip hop legend Choclair and earned over $10,000 in crowdfunding presales and their self-titled debut EP was mixed and mastered by Alan Evans of Soulive. Both albums promise to have you rocking out and singing along to catchy melodies and funky grooves. But if you truly want to find out what comes after the funk, you’ll just have to come experience it for yourself.
Root Shock: Root SHOCK was formed in Winter of 2012 with veteran musicians whose love of reggae music flows deep. Blending roots reggae, dancehall, heavy drum & bass and soulful vocals with conscious lyrics into positive dance music will make you want to move! 

Root Shock has been surprising and delighting crowds across the Central New York region, bringing their unique high-energy style spearheaded by the stunning vocals of Jessica Brown to a wide range of settings. The band’s dedication to spreading music with a positive message has paid off in entertaining, elevating, and energizing music lovers of all walks of life! </p>

Additional Info:
Haewa: "Haewa can be better described by what it isn't. The group jams, but it isn't a jam band. It circles psychedelic rock, but doesn't get lost in the ether. It's a rock 'n' roll band that doesn't adhere to merely the one, the four, and the five. It's odd, but not intentionally obtuse...." - Frank DeBlasePine Needle Soul is a band from Rochester NY featuring an MC, guitar, vocals, bass, keys, sax, and drums. We play in the style of hip hop fusion.Joe Driscoll:An innovator of the live looping beatbox sound, Joe Driscoll has been touring steadily for years, spreading his unique fusion of folk and hip-hop. The modern day take on the one man band, he uses live loops to create soundscapes full of beatbox, guitar, harmonica, percussion, harmonica, and just about anything else he can make use of. After 11 years living in England and France, Joe has moved back to his native city, Syracuse in upstate New York. Driscoll has performed his ground breaking solo show at the famed Glastonbury Festival, Electric Picnic in Ireland, Rift Valley Fest in Kenya, and hundreds of major stages all over the world.

"Adirondack Freight Train String Music"

Hailing from Saranac Lake, NY, in the heart of the Adirondack mountains, The Blind Owl Band has been creating what they call Freight Train String Music since 2010. And a freight train it truly is. Although the quartet's sound is rooted in traditional stringed instruments (guitar, basses, banjo and mandolin), their music surges forward with the strength and power of a hundred-ton diesel locomotive. Songs barrel down the tracks with momentum and intensity normally found in much heavier, heavily amplified music. “Although we look like a bluegrass band we are not," explains co-founder Eric Munley (mandolin, vocals). "Collectively, we're a musical representation of the sounds floating around in our heads. We use the instruments of our ancestors, but play music of our time; we're influenced much more by all that has happened in the musical world over the past three decades than by what was created in the first three-quarters of the 20th Century." The Blind Owl Band builds on what they regard as a basic approach to traditional songwriting and arranging and push the envelope, stretching the limits of raw, acoustic instrumentation. Munley explains part of the band's mindset: "In a time of perfection and an increasing reliance on digital processors, we're trying to expand the sound, to inspire use of wood and metal." In just under five years the band has released two albums (Rabble Rousing and This Train We Ride is Made of Wood and Steel) and toured extensively throughout the eastern US, logging nearly 600 show across 17 states since January 2012. They've played on almost every festival east of the Mississippi and shared the stage with countless artists across all genres of the musical spectrum. Looking ahead into 2017, the band will begin recording their as-yet-untitled third full length album in early summer, with an eye toward a October 13th, 2017 release. This freight train has no one conductor but four shovel boys pushing the limits of their engine night after night, so climb aboard and get ready for a one-of-a-kind ride. </p>

                                        <p> Corey Owens is affectionately known as Big C.  He is also the guy who holds down the drums with Danielle Ponder & The Tomorrow People.  On top of that, he is the man behind Big Boy Catering, which creates some of the best food I have ever eaten.  

As a Holiday treat for you, Big C is putting on a special event at Three Heads.  It is a 2 part event.   

First up, he will be catering a dinner at the brewery for the first 80 people that buy tickets.  That will occur at 6pm and there will be acoustic music provided by Mr. Eli Flynn.  

Then at 8pm, the music hits.  Big C will be leading a band of incredible players:  Avis Reese, Matt Ramerman and Andres Rivera from the Tommorow People, John Viviani from Blue Falcon and Filthy Funk and Tony G from Giant Panda.  Rumors are there will also be an All Star cast of guest singers.   

Tickets are $20 for the dinner and music.
They will be $10 for just the music.  
They will be on sale shortly...stay tuned. </p>

Additional Info:
Pearly Baker's Best is a Grateful Dead tribute with both a weekly residency and a devoted following at one of the top local venues in Syracuse, NY every Monday night. Playing the music of The Grateful Dead, The Jerry Garcia Band, The Beatles and other covers they delight their devout followers with a powerful show once a week out of the band's current song list which tops 180 songs. The band's strong improvisational foundation leads the way, allowing their sets to be visualized much like weaving a tapestry; each thread of verse, chorus or bridge is expertly weaved into the fabric of their sound and playing to be completely embraced by their audience. Also, careful attention is always given to ensuring that each song is treated with the necessary vocal ingredients to cause the listener to be drawn into the music at the deepest level. The band's desire is to provide each audience member with a 'Grateful Dead-like experience,' allowing them to encounter the show as a translational, musical undertaking. Currently PBB can go 9 shows without repeating a song and is always adding to it's ever expanding catalog of 200 songs which includes original songs on occasion. The band does play shows in addition to their weekly residency in Syracuse, all across New York State. The band has begun to incorporate original music into their sets and recently had the privilege of sharing their stage with David Gans; long-time archivist for the Grateful Dead, broadcaster, song writer and music journalist. David expressed a strong desire to share the stage with Pearly Baker's again in the near future. There is truly nothing like a Pearly Baker's Best show.

John Brown's Body
www.johnbrownsbody.com
Together for two decades and hailed as “Future roots, reggae, and dub with an intricately balanced weaving of vocals, percussion, keyboard, bass, guitar, and stunning 3-piece horn section that ties it all together” (WRUV), John Brown’s Body (JBB) is building “a legacy that has inspired and carved a path for the now thriving contemporary American reggae scene” (Rudeboy Reggae). Formed in Ithaca, New York, in the mid 1990s, at a time when there wasn’t yet a far-reaching U.S. reggae scene, JBB was one of a small handful of U.S. reggae bands that began touring nationally. Since then, JBB has played an important role in helping define distinctly “American reggae.” JBB’s music is steeped in traditional vibes, but unapologetically incorporates elements from other genres. While most American reggae bands tackled typical reggae themes (such as religion and marijuana), JBB acted more like an indie band, writing songs that used the vocabulary of reggae to express their own experiences. Their unique approach resonated with the masses. The group’s 2008 full-length record, Amplify, hit #1 on the Billboard Reggae Chart, 2012’s JBB In Dub EP reached #1 on iTunes’ Reggae Chart, and in 2013 Kings And Queens topped both Billboard and iTunes Reggae Charts at #1. Today, JBB’s signature style has become the norm for U.S. reggae bands - and many in the genre admittedly point to John Brown’s Body as a key influence. </p>

Driftwood
www.driftwoodtheband.com
When most people think of upstate New York, they either imagine bucolic landscapes or working-class towns. As natives of Binghamton, the members of Driftwood hail from a working town, but play music rooted in the land, leaning alternately into folk, old-time, country, punk, and rock, depending on their personal moods and their songs' needs.

"It's sometimes tough to keep any sort of focus on style or sound when you have three different songwriters," guitarist Dan Forsyth concedes. "But it also allows us to branch out and explore in ways other bands don't. Also, I think it's important, as a band, to ask ourselves 'Is this a good next step?' I think everyone is very excited to know that it is." Describing the Driftwood sound, banjo player Joe Kollar offers, "I consider our sound to be more of an attitude and an approach - the result of all of our influences in a completely open musical forum where the only stipulation is to use bluegrass instruments and create it from the heart."

That's as close to being pinned down as Driftwood ever gets. Such has always been the case for artists blurring and blending genre lines in order to innovate. Yes, they wield old-time instruments, but they do so with a punk-rock ethos. "I do not know much about punk music, but I do know that it gives me a feeling of tearing into something without inhibition," violinist Claire Byrne says, adding, "Old-time music has the same feeling for me. The music was a release for people living extremely hard lives in harsh conditions. In this way, the two styles of music are very similar: It's digging in and making a statement. It's rocking out and feeling totally reborn through the song."

Driftwood has been digging in and rocking out since their 2005 formation, playing an average of 150 shows a year. "In the beginning, we hit the road constantly with an all-or-nothing attitude," Forsyth confides. "We were doing it with a lot of passion, but had no thoughts about long-term sustainability. Life outside of the band was minimal. One thing that I think we started to notice was, when you're always in it, you have no perspective and you start to lose yourself in a weird way."

As such, gigging and traveling that much can't help but influence and inform the band, individually and collectively. In the past, they used the stage to work out arrangements of new songs. For City Lights, they used the studio. "Keeping this kind of touring schedule, we have thought of recording albums as a sort of secondary thing and considered ourselves a 'live' band. We learn so much on the road and this kind of work has always felt productive," Forsyth explains. "It wasn't until this last album that we took some time off to learn more about being in the studio. We wanted to take our time and record on our own terms."

According to Byrne, their own terms included "taking a step forward with the production and the arrangements." Kollar tacks "learning" on, for good measure, while Forsyth adds "good songs and bigger arrangements, and sounds than we had not previously achieved."

Even though they come from different directions, the three founding members - along with bassist Joey Arcuri - tend to end up at the same place. That unity, as well as the joy derived from playing together, can be heard throughout City Lights.

As further evidence of their compatibility, both Forsyth and Byrne tag "Skin and Bone" as the head of the album. It's a Kollar composition that he says "came from a reflection I had of myself and life on the road, in general. It touches on trying to keep perspective, forging ahead, and embracing the future." Clearly, that's a state of mind they can all relate to.

The heart of the album, though, is a toss up with Forsyth choosing the romance of "Too Afraid," Byrne picking the nostalgia of "The Waves," and Kollar tapping the excitement of the title track. That disparity may be because, in their decade together, the musicians have all undergone monumental life changes. They have come into their own... together. Forsyth is now a husband and father; Byrne is now a recorded songwriter. "Generally speaking, there's a maturity to us now," Kollar explains. "We have a bit of experience doing what we do and the music reflects that point of view. The song subjects, our playing/singing abilities, our recording abilities, and our relationships have all matured."

Forsyth picks up the thread, "We have all learned an unbelievable amount of patience and teamwork strategy. Our band is close: Everyone knows a lot about each other. We travel in very tight quarters constantly and are always up on what's happening in each others' lives. I think this has really enabled us to express ourselves, individually and as a group, but also to understand each other and others in so many ways."

Having joined Driftwood when she was 21, Byrne has spent her whole adult life in the band "learning to play and sing in a group, learning the art of performance, and, of course, learning who I am and what my purpose(s) in life are. I think you can hear those changes from the first record to the last one." Because City Lights marks her songwriting debut, she feels like her personal growth is on full display. "Rather than just listening to my harmonies and fiddle playing, you now have lyrics, as well. I think the songs I have on this record reflect a woman going through a great shift in her life, settling down a bit, and reflecting on the many different ways that affects me and my relationships with others."

As the sole woman of the band, Byrne puts a clearly different spin on things. "Sometimes, instead of thinking about adding a feminine perspective, I actually spend time thinking about how to make myself fit in with the guys and, therefore, dumbing down my femininity a bit," she says. "With my songwriting, though, there is no hiding it. I'm talking about things from a woman's perspective that many other women will be able to relate to easier than they would if a man was writing and singing about the same topics."

One topic the three songwriters all agree on is home. In their own ways, they each love and reflect their hard-scrabble hometown. "Growing up in the Chenango Bridge/Binghamton area, I never really thought about it being an economically depressed town. To me, it was a perfect balance of rivers, woods, campfires, street signs, factories, and city lights," Kollar says, referencing the new album's title. "Now, I know a little more about it being a post-industrial town, but still I see it as a diamond in the rough. I relate to the sort of underdog/uphill feel of the town."

Byrne adds, "I think coming from a place such as Binghamton makes us very raw. We are a reflection of where we grew up. There isn't really anything fancy about us - we aren't the 'hippest' group out there, as far as fashion goes - but we are certainly very real. What you see is what you get."

Milkweed
https://www.milkweedtheband.com/home
 Milkweed is a band that was born on Main Street in the quiet post industrial city of Binghamton NY.  It is the collaboration of three artists - Joseph Alston, Jacqualine Colombo and Peter Lister.  Without committing to one genre Milkweed has pulled from many of the great aspects of American music and created their own brand of American song and story telling.  Whether it is blue grass guitar flat picking, Chicago blues harmonica, Irish ballads or Jersey shore folk songs, Milkweed weaves together the sounds that make up the rich tapestry of American music history. With their lyrics they set themselves apart from the norm, taking the simple stories of everyday people and telling them through the lens of dreams and what it means to be a human.  The root of the bands sound is in the use of three part harmony to impart a sense of importance and depth to their lyrics that brings the listener into their songs and feel invested in it.

Milkweeds debut full length album, Dream of An American Family, was released in November of 2015.  It consists of thirteen original songs ranging from fingerpicking ballads, up tempo picking tunes, to a piedmont blues inspired song.  It was recorded by Don Sternecker at the great Mixolydian Studios and was crafted to be like the great folk albums of the past, predominantly live and in front of great microphones.  Songs from the album have received praise and radio play throughout the Northeast and East Coast and has gotten Milkweed onto larger theater and festival stages over the last year.  Upon the arrival of a new tour van the band has been on the road  prolifically, playing more then 160 shows a year.  With the advent of a new album close at hand, longer tours booked nationally and collaborations with other musicians, Milkweed shows no sign of slowing down. </p>

Additional Info:
The seeds of Dirty Blanket were planted in 2013 at the meeting of lead guitarist Max "Dirty" Flansburg and lead singer/songwriter Kevin "Blanket" O'Leary. Combining an array of unique musical influences with a shared passion for creating new original music, the two began playing as an acoustic duo. Utilizing what free time their other musical projects allowed to book gigs across Upstate NY, they eventually found themselves opening for acts as large as Jeff Austin of the Yonder Mountain String Band and beyond. The summer of 2016 saw the duo's sound take a shift toward a more heavily bluegrass-influenced style, with Max and Kevin crafting new originals and taking to the stage to cover the music of such Americana legends as Hot Rize, Newgrass Revival, the Del McCoury Band, and the like.Root SHOCK was formed in Winter of 2012 with veteran musicians whose love of reggae music flows deep. Blending roots reggae, dancehall, heavy drum & bass and soulful vocals with conscious lyrics into positive dance music will make you want to move!

The Blind Owl Band, Saranac Lake, NY
"Freight Train String Music"
www.theblindowlband.com

Hailing from Saranac Lake, NY, in the heart of the Adirondack mountains, The Blind Owl Band has been creating what they call Freight Train String Music since 2010. And a freight train it truly is. Although the quartet's sound is rooted in traditional stringed instruments (guitar, basses, banjo and mandolin), their music surges forward with the strength and power of a hundred-ton diesel locomotive. Songs barrel down the tracks with momentum and intensity normally found in much heavier, heavily amplified music. “Although we look like a bluegrass band we are not," explains co-founder Eric Munley (mandolin, vocals). "Collectively, we're a musical representation of the sounds floating around in our heads. We use the instruments of our ancestors, but play music of our time; we're influenced much more by all that has happened in the musical world over the past three decades than by what was created in the first three-quarters of the 20th Century." The Blind Owl Band builds on what they regard as a basic approach to traditional songwriting and arranging and push the envelope, stretching the limits of raw, acoustic instrumentation. Munley explains part of the band's mindset: "In a time of perfection and an increasing reliance on digital processors, we're trying to expand the sound, to inspire use of wood and metal." In just under five years the band has released two albums (Rabble Rousing and This Train We Ride is Made of Wood and Steel) and toured extensively throughout the eastern US, logging nearly 600 show across 17 states since January 2012. They've played on almost every festival east of the Mississippi and shared the stage with countless artists across all genres of the musical spectrum. Looking ahead into 2017, the band will begin recording their as-yet-untitled third full length album in early summer, with an eye toward a October 13th, 2017 release. This freight train has no one conductor but four shovel boys pushing the limits of their engine night after night, so climb aboard and get ready for a one-of-a-kind ride.

The Mallett Brothers Band - Portland, Maine 
http://www.mallettbrothersband.com/

"The Mallett Brothers Band packed their first four albums chock-full of crackling Americana, a foot-stomping patchwork of country, folk, and rock. But the usually rowdy sextet hits quieter notes on their latest album, The Falling of the Pine, a ruminative collection of 19th-century lumber-camp songs lent new melodies and arrangements. Across 10 tracks of rich instrumentation and absorbing harmonies, the Portland-based Malletts revitalize bygone tales of the triumphs and yearnings of working Mainers. For state history buffs — or for fans of the Avett Brothers, Okkervil River, or even Springsteen — the Malletts’ record deserves a serious listen." - Down East Magazine

Formed in 2009 in Portland, Maine, The Mallett Brothers Band is an independent, nationally touring country rock and roll band consisting of brothers Luke and Will Mallett (vocals, guitar), Nick Leen (bass guitar), Wally (dobro, vocals, guitar), Andrew Martelle (fiddle, mandolin), and Chuck Gagne (drums).

                                        <p> Folkfaces is a group out of Buffalo, NY that plays a rowdy blend of rootsy Folk, Jazz, and Blues - fusing classic forms with contemporary feelings and irresistibly danceable energy. 

Their inspiration comes from the mountains of Appalachia to the deltas of Mississippi, the swamps of Louisiana to the Concrete Jungle of the Rustbelt. Specializing in merriment and sticking it to the system, Folkfaces make the crowd dance and the hierarchy shatter.

Although the quartet's sound is rooted in traditional stringed instruments (guitar, basses, banjo and mandolin), their music surges forward with the strength and power of a hundred-ton diesel locomotive. Songs barrel down the tracks with momentum and intensity normally found in much heavier, heavily amplified music. “Although we look like a bluegrass band we are not," explains co-founder Eric Munley (mandolin, vocals). "Collectively, we're a musical representation of the sounds floating around in our heads. We use the instruments of our ancestors, but play music of our time; we're influenced much more by all that has happened in the musical world over the past three decades than by what was created in the first three-quarters of the 20th Century." The Blind Owl Band builds on what they regard as a basic approach to traditional songwriting and arranging and push the envelope, stretching the limits of raw, acoustic instrumentation. Munley explains part of the band's mindset: "In a time of perfection and an increasing reliance on digital processors, we're trying to expand the sound, to inspire use of wood and metal." In just under five years the band has released two albums (Rabble Rousing and This Train We Ride is Made of Wood and Steel) and toured extensively throughout the eastern US, logging nearly 600 show across 17 states since January 2012. They've played on almost every festival east of the Mississippi and shared the stage with countless artists across all genres of the musical spectrum. Looking ahead into 2017, the band will begin recording their as-yet-untitled third full length album in early summer, with an eye toward a October 13th, 2017 release. This freight train has no one conductor but four shovel boys pushing the limits of their engine night after night, so climb aboard and get ready for a one-of-a-kind ride.

Bella's Bartok - Northampton, MA

The circus punk powerhouse Bella’s Bartok infuses klezmer punk with pop sensibilities into a spectacle that can’t help but compel you dance!

To understand Bella’s Bartok, imagine what you would get if Salvador Dali and Toulouse Lautrec were fronting the Moulin Rouge's house band, and you have the exuberant spectacle that is Bella's Bartok. Described as "about as much fun as you can have with your pants on" (Dan Wolovick, Two Way Monologues), this 6-piece powerhouse melds Bohemian Klezmer Punk with pop sensibilities into an eminently danceable party. The diversity of musicians that make up Bella's Bartok, combined with their boundless energy on stage, has been known to break a dancefloor, or two (or three, but who's counting?). Their sound moves way beyond labels, pushing the envelope towards the darker side of Eastern European music, referencing vaudeville and 20th century eclecticism. 
The Bella's Bartok line-up includes: Asher Putnam (Vocals and all-around entertainer), Chris "Fancy" Kerrigan (Guitar, Clarinet, Vocals), Dan Niederhauser (Bass and Vocals), Amory Drennan (Trombone/Banjo and Vocals), Crisco (Drums/Percussion and Trumpet) and Gershon Rosen (trumpet). The band has shared the stage with musicians and acts such as Rubblebucket, Red Baraat, The Indigo Girls, Larry & His Flask, The Suitcase Junket, Parsonsfield, And the Kids, Kanye, Rough Francis, Beau Sasser’s Escape Plan, West End Blend, Adam Ezra Group, Meat Puppets, World Inferno/Friendship Society, Rupa & the April Fishes, Arc Iris, and many more.
With multiple awards under their belts, including The Valley Advocate's Best Band in the Valley 2014 and The Deli Magazine's Best of New England (twice!), this eclectic group of guys have carefully crafted a sound that is part strange and creepy, part pop gold. With an aura of theatricality, Bella's Bartok shows not only entertain, but they invite you to partake in the wild party they are having on stage, to involve yourself in the spectacle. Quite simply put- this is the band you should never miss, ever.

                                        <p> Based out of Western NY, the English Project has solidified itself in the North Eastern U.S. as a collective that pushes the envelope of groove and improvisation. Comprised of core members Chris English on drums and vocals, Paul McArdle on guitar, Andres Rivera on bass and Dave Solazzo on piano, the English Project seamlessly fuses funk and soul with elements of modern jazz. They’ve also opened for artists such as Bobby Brown, Arrested Development, Jazz is Phsh, Giant Panda Guerrilla Dub Squad, Sophistafunk, Thunderbody, John Kadlecik Band, and many others. Their debut EP, “The English Project, Vol.1” is OUT NOW. </p>
